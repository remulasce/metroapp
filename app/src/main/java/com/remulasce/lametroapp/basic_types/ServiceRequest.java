/**
 * Created by Remulasce on 12/16/2014.
 *
 * One (or maybe more) servicerequest should be created for each input into the omnibar
 * Its job is to create the subsequent data types and get them started tracking
 *
 * There's not much top-down control, mainly it just starts them up and lets it go.
