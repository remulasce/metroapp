 * Created by Remulasce on 6/11/2015.
 *
 * This is a little half-baked because we didn't go and clean up the rest of the statics
 * This interface narrowly converts stopids->routes within an SQL table
 * Like, string to string.
 *
 * We hve a separate interface that actually takes a Stop and returns proper Routes.
 * Something something something abstraction.
