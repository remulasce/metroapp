        # you add multiple rows("records") mapping the stop to each route.
        # So each row ROWn says "Stop s has ROUTEn"
        #
        # To get all the routes to a stop, you query sqlite for all the rows
        # with stopid matching.
        #
        # Obviously the Internet won't tell you outright, but this makes sense to me
        # because to add new information, you don't need to access any previous info-
        # you just add a new row.
