    Regionalization helper now defaults to Los Angeles.
    
    I don't think location services can be counted on like it used to. So
    this is good for the folks using this in the city after which it is
    named.

    Fix agency -> filename mapping issue
    
    In this issue, all .db files for autocomplete were assumed to be
    "agencyname.db".
    
    This assumption is not actually true, due to capitaliziation and random
    stabs at bug-fixing.
    
    Hence now InstalledAgencyChecker knows what agencies go to what.

    Fix missing route color for "Dublin / Pleasanton" and "Richmond"
    
    The issue was Cat's old BART scraper had a misspelling of south_roots.
    So the northernmost stations wouldn't have any routes at all. Plenty of
    roots though, I guess.

    Looks like AS somehow didn't notice file changes in the assets/

    Also, note since VTA and Caltrain have been capitalized, the hardcoded
    prediction manager had to be updated as well.

    511 site contains all agencies in the Bay, but uses a really fucked API.
    So you have to cross-consult static GTFS data to get stop locations.
    
    GTFS files for VTA added and generated. Use commandline argument <vta> to
    generate just VTA in the new scraper_bayarea_511.
    
    I don't know if it works yet because I need to modify the app to check.

    Fix #299, don't display bart vehicles that don't exist
    
    Bart doesn't have vehicle numbers, so we can't specify which arrival to
    track in NotifyService.
    
    Therefore, don't give the user the option to select different vehicles in
    the confirmation dialog, because only the first arrival will be tracked.

    Added support for regionalization
    
    Added ios support for regionalization code so that it interfaces with regionalization helper and returns agencies for whatever active agencies exist there.
    
    Installed agencies load at runtime.
    
    Still need to add UI so we can redo search for active agencies and select agencies manually.
    
    Also, have array of installed agencies rather than looking through all database files, maybe change this later, though I don't particularly like just reading all db files.

    Related #304, fix some dependency issues with RegionalizationHelper
    
    - Handle "no location provider set" without crashing
    - Handle "no persistence set" by using autodetect instead of default "add
      all agencies"
    - Fail-faster when trying to load active agencies when there are no
      installed agencies
    
    Remaining, unfixed:
    - We should verify each persisted active agency is actually installed when
      we load it. Otherwise we could have active agencies set that don't
      actually exist.

    Don't require a persistence deal to use RegionalizationHelper
    
    See iss #304
    I forgot to add one "if(persistence != null)" check when the autodetect
    state is changed.
    
    Persistence shouldn't be a requirement of the Helper, just nice for the
    user.

    Implemented GlobalLocationProvider on iOS
    
    So, it is possible to implement things java expects on the ios side, as long as you do all the interface things manually. It causes runtime errors if everything isn't perfect, but it works.
    
    So GlobalLocationProvider is implemented on ios now.
    
    Still need to add switching system with platform dep UI code.

    Region auto-switch deal
    
    It's in regionalizationhelper.
    
    The agencies themselves, including locations, are still hardcoded.
    So for now if the helper sees an agency with no bounds, it will simply
    always add it.
    
    But, it does check current location against agency bounds if it exists!
    
    Note, there's no option to do this. It happens every 60 seconds.
    So there still is work to do:
    
    - Load the actual installed agencies, with all their info
    - Give option for autotoggle in settings popup
    - Let the user know when regions change
    
    Note, this commit changes the Agency definition, clearing the serialized
    saved autocomplete entries.

    First steps to auto-region detection
    
    On getActiveAgencies call, check if it's been a while since we've
    auto-updated and get our current location if so.
    
    I'm using the GlobalLocationProvider singleton which we already made. I
    added an additional method for getting just the current location.

    BART support in ArrivalNotifyService, #292
    
    Un-fucked parts of NotifyService. Now it uses LaMetroUtil for both
    determining the update URL, and also for parsing the response into
    arrivals.
    
    This way the arrivalservice won't need to keep getting updated every time
    we add a new provider type.
    
    Currently testing. Remaining is to deal with displaying to the user that
    s/he can't actually select which bart vehicle to track, since there's no
    vehicle numbers. It will default out to first arrival, even though there's
    radio buttons for each.

    Fix #295, BART stops distance display as '0'
    
    Issue was in stop.isValid(), which LAMetroUtil was trying to verify was a
    stop number. However BART uses letter designations internally, throwing an
    exception.
    
    Fixed by removing the "check it's a number" code from LaMetroUtil

    Manual Region-switching works!
    
    Settings dialog allows you to switch agencies on and off, updating when
    any checkbox is changed.
    
    Autocomplete now loads all installed agencies at start, but only searches
    through those that are active, rechecking active list every query.
    
    So that means for non-history stops, this works perfectly.
    
    For stops already in recent history, they work if selected. So it's an
    option we have to not show recent stops if they are not an active agency.
    
    Remaining:
    - Persist "Active Agencies" between instances
    - Auto-switching regions, and related items.
    
    Optional tasks:
    - Define proper names for agencies, and show them
    - Check what agencies are actually installed when setting "Installed
      agencies", instead of hardcoding them in Main

    Adding BART for regional hot alpha
    
    BART should be good for the test tomorrow. I had to do a couple of sorta quasi-not as nice as possible hacks to get it working, but the framework is nicely built so not too much of that.
    
    Possible problems:
    Code scaling to all GTFS data?
    API key is hard coded, only in one place, so shouldn't be a problem.
    Tiredness caused some weak code? I don't think so, sleep is for the weak.

    Add actual .dbs, halfway through fixing norcal stuff
    
    So the nextrip server isn't actually returning back the stopid you sent it
    with. So I'm improperly assuming some things about the stopid and filling
    it in in the return from the server, which fails to match what we sent and
    gets rejected.
    
    So what needs to happen is whoever knows the stop, agency, etc of the
    request needs to fill it in when it gets base arrivals back from
    lametroutil.

    Ok, we finally have an alright looking search function on the iOS version.
    It has a nice dropshadow while it's displayed, though it is fixed height because I don't feel like it's worth a crapload of effort to get it to do a dynamic height searchbar which isn't really even in the iOS spec.

    Fixes for #273
    
    Handle the "no network any more" state better by not totally giving up.
    Allow the notification sound to play even if it's been 5 minutes since a
    network update
    Show the user the actual time it's been since the last network update
    
    For debug, update every 15 seconds.

    Calculate correct routecolors for input bar; colorer bug fix
    
    Changes:
    - HardcodedRouteColorer bug fix on string compare
    - New interface StopRoutesTable used for String -> Strings conversion,
      with old StopRoutesTranslator used for Stop -> Routes.
    - MetroStaticsProvider deals with regionalized Stop-Routes tables,
      translates between the String -> String table and makes the actual
      routes.
    - OmniAutoCompleteAdapter checks what colors it needs, doesn't do anything
      with them.

    Add stupid level of regionalization support for RouteColorer.
    
    With Routes now having their Agency, the hardcoded route colorer can be
    slightly more smart.
    
    A proper fix for this would be to generate a table for it. Nextrip should
    actually have the colors itself. So the whole file is going to be trashed
    eventually anyway.

    This thing is actually necessary, as it turns out.
    
    Nighelles should work with me to figure out how he's not setup properly.
    It's probably something where the RegionalizationHelper needs the regions
    to be set, or something.

    Only hide autocomplete progress spinner if current text was filtered
    
    The spinner used to stop too early, as the first few letters' results
    would cause the spinner to halt, but the rest of the text had not been
    returned.
    
    So now wait until the actual text has been filtered.
    
    Android doesn't actually give you enough information to do that. so we had
    to override some stuff and make a listener, etc.

    Looks like it was in the initial commit for the original, single-threaded
    notify service design.
    
    The threads now aren't doing anything that would require special

    (which had additional stops).

    No longer translate stop locations in LaMetroUtil
    
    This is to avoid having to regionalize in parseAllArrivals.
    All of Utils shouldn't try to produce full-featured objects- just
    convenience methods.
    
    To do that properly, it should probably not reuse all the same data types.
    But they're convenient.
    
    Instead of providing the location, you should rely on already knowing the
    stop location at ServiceRequest creation time.
    All you should rely on Utils for is stuff you already know- like parsing
    things.

    Use the full, existing stop instead of one made from nextrip.
    
    In SRDP, SRDPArrivals were made with the Stop that came from LaMetroUtil.
    That Stop doesn't have the regionalization info.
    
    So instead use the STop that it was originally created with.

    Replacing Database with new Database
    
    Merged the lametro-rail.db with lametro.db, so it's now using the new scraped
    database. This should allow us to no longer waste time looking for duplicates in the database.

    Remove all these bogus project files.
    
    files shouldn't have been VCed even when there was a project in app.
    Which there isn't any more.

    Woot! Merged.
    
    Including removing most of the bogus files.
    app/build.gradle is probably a remaining bogus file.
    along with app/build/*
    
    Also, Nighelles's scraper fix sholud be included somewhere back there.

    Merge branch 'iosport' into merge_iosdev
    
    It might even work!
    
    Mainly because in order to fix project-settings conflicts, I've gone and
    removed all the bs project files that shouldn't have been there in the
    first place.

    Bugfix issue 216: Bad Comparison Code
    
    Trip priority comparator in sorting would not handle trips with equal
    priority. Instead of reporting 'equal', it would select one side to be
    higher.
    
    This is incorrect, since if the priority code happened to swap the
    argument order, it would receive the opposite result.
    
    This is what happened to a user, whose instance promptly crashed.

    Status dismissal works better.
    
    Now status trip stays dismissed instead of reappearing an instant later.
    Dismissed status can be returned through the Request.
    
    Probably need to automatically restore it if new errors occur, or
    something.
    
    Maybe?
    
    The error message only occurse if there's literally nothing else displayed
    for that request.

    Status trip comes up during fetch and for error.

    ServiceRequest makes status trip.
    
    There's no platform UI yet- TripPopulator only kind of sort of handles
    this case.
    
    Swipe to dismiss doesn't properly scale/work. It looks like it works- but
    I'm not sure if it's actually dismissing the correct items.
    
    This won't be a problem once we get UI in for it, but TripPopulator should
    really do a better job of handling Trips for which it can't make views
    for.
    
    Maybe a 'MissingView', with just a text name.

    Add StatusTrip
    
    It's a thin pass-through for the underlying StopServiceRequest's network
    state.
    
    Small change exposes the Request's state to the Trip, so the Trip can do
    the logic and not rely on the Request doing a lot.
    
    I think it works better that way.

    Fixed Search, Regionalization
    
    I fixed the geosearch on the IOS version, though for now the code is all in the platform specific code, so that can get fixed when I have some time to refactor. I also fixed the implementation of the LaMetroUtil to refer to a singleton RegionalizationHelper object that keeps track of the agency name. So that's working now, and I just need to do a check of which region you're in before loading the correct database.

    Ugh. iml files.
    
    Research shows they ... can? be ignored?
    But there's some settings that /should/ be saved in them.
    
    It seems to mainly affect initial setup- you may have to do some initial
    configuring if you don't include the .imls, even though they're mostly
    regenerated every so often.
    
    For now just keep them in.

    All the features are implemented now. Nothing is pretty, but it's all working.
    I also scraped all the databases. This build works for ac transit cause I need to test it. Widget is odd, I think that's because the debug toolchain isn't working, but it should work on a distribution build.

    Fixed Totally Whack SRDA
    
    I don't know how to put just that change onto anything else, so Remulasce will have to change that on android if he feels like it.
    
    Also did some stuff to fix notifications, and added notifications for when you click on a stop. I just need the nice reminder window that lets you select which arrival to add, because right now it just does the next one, which is not what its supposed to do. That should be the last fix before a usable alpha version.
    Well, actually I also want to add a fix so that it selects which database to use
    when you start the app, but that's potentially not required for the alpha.

    Rudimentary Widget Support
    
    I've added the framwork necessary to do a widget with communication with the main app. This is tricky becuase I had to do some stuff in the apple dev portal as well as synch shared app groups and what not in order to get the ios sandboxing scheme to recognize that I was allowed to share data.
    
    Right now, clicking on a multiarrivaltrip being displayed in the bottom pane adds a thing to the today screen showing basically the name of the trip and how much time was left when you clicked it. Not tremendously helpful atm, but since I've demonstrated the technical problems are solved, I'm commiting. Next commit should hopefully make this feature usable so we can start alpha testing the ios version.

    Add hashcode / equals in BasicLocation for Hashmap indexing
    
    This lets us use a BasicLocation as a key for hashmaps, and multiple
    things checking to the same location will return the same thing.
    
    So we can make caches easily.
    
    I don't think it's actual good practice- probably you'd want the cacher
    itself to figure out what things are equal.
    But this is a quick cheap solution for the home-gamer.

    Dropdown dismiss after 2s; improvement to status bar.
    
    I'm not satisfied with the dropdown stay-open. I think it probably gets in
    the way of the add-one-stop use case, and Android's totally hidden all the
    good stuff, so I can't easily add a touchlistener to prevent
    hiding-after-touch.
    
    However, rooting through the Android docs did find me this weird trick to
    make the progress spinner more accurate.
    
    The hard way to do the dropdown thing is to set my own invisible view on
    top of the known dropdown area, and check that for touch. But I'd like to
    figure out the actual proper use case for this dropdown persist thing. I
    may have to predict whether the user is going to add multiple stops,
    either by remembering how often he does that, or maybe checking
    accelerometer/gps to see if he's walking, which would mean just get him
    his one station he's walking to.
    
    Basically don't dump more work into this until you figure out what you
    want it to do.

    This makes it more likely to pick up the very first update run quicker.

    Increase proportion of history autocomplete priority from proximity
    
    The history autocomplete, which is the only thing that shows up
    immediately on app start, is really designed for adding the very first
    stop. Like as though you're walking and can't type the whole thing.
    
    So let's prioritize the very first, most important stop the most, instead
    of every stop you've ever taken.
    
    You can use the regular string-match autocomplete to get to whatever
    far-flung destination you want, once you know you don't have to run any
    more.

    History based autocomplete, plus some weirdness.
    
    History is based on per-app-open. No saving yet.
    What should happen is that the autocompletedropdown gets activated on 0
    characters, but only displays recents until you reach 3 characters.
    
    What happens is you still need to type 1 character in for it to work.
    
    Once you reach 3 characters, sql returns and history suggestions integrate
    nicely.
    
    However, 0-2 characters don't filter or prioritize the history, which
    would be nice.
    
    Also, no priority on nearest history. That would be fairly easy to
    implement though.

    Error when I added the 'display distance to station' feature.
    You don't want to have to calculate distance that often.
    Priority code already throttled this and saved it in the Trips, so just
    made that data accessible to the display, and use that.

    Stripped out ServiceRequestHandler.
    
    Like literally. With ServiceRequests knowing how to get their own trips,
    and TripPopulator doing UI updates, this file doesn't even need its own
    update thread any more.
    
    It's basically just a List of Requests, plus a convenience method to get
    all the trips for those requests in order.

    Works on Android now again.
    
    Refactor: ServiceRequests now have the getTrips() method.
    That way RequestHandler, TripPopulator don't need special logic for each
    ServiceRequest.
    Also, it didn't make sense for Predictions to have to make their own
    Trips. Imagine a ServiceRequest for scheduled departures which doesn't
    need the network for anything.
    
    Future work should remove Trips from the Predictions, and have something
    else look at the predictions/arrivals and make the Trip.
    
    Since each ServiceRequest can do its custom trip-tracking logic within
    itself, we don't need to use the TripUpdated callback any more. It hasn't
    been removed yet.
    
    With a TripPopulator surrounding the RequestHandler, the app is functional
    again on Android.

    Shortened vehicle message, right-aligned field
    
    In TripItem, the vehicle text was wrapping to two lines on 480p displays.
    
    So the text has been shortened from "vehicle ####" to "veh ####"
    The field has also been right-justified from the screen edge instead of
    locked to the predicted time field, so it should be better expandable.

    For those not paying attention since v.1:
    - "Omnibar" search box- type in the stop in the ActionBar instead of dealing
    - with the old three-boxes.
    - Omnibar input fully accepts proper names- you can type the full "Union
    - Station", etc names, and they will be accepted.
    - Robust input autocomplete means you don't actually have to type those long
            names
    - You can still just put in stopids if you want
    - Autocomplete entries are ranked partially by GPS proximity
    - Multiple tracked stops are shown in the screen that used to be input boxes

    Converted SQL from text to double for location, and throughout.
    I probably should have done actual profiling, but it looks like a lot of
    time was spent just converting strings to doubles.
    
    So now the location is parsed immediately as a double in SQL, and is
    passed that way throughout.
    
    Also, minor cleanliness / exception checks.

    Autocomplete!
    
    There were some issues with the adapter, probably still are.
    
    Autocomplete is provided by an SQL query, WHERE stopname LIKE %text%
    So that means if the char string is exactly included anywhere in the
    stopname, it will be returned.
    
    One issue: Large number of stuff can be returned. Mitigated by textview
    threshold
    Two issue: You have to enter contiguous phrases, whereas it should sort of
    search each word individually.

    Frameworking of stopnamesqlhelper is wrong.
    
    Sql helper will handle when to call initialization, so the code I wrote
    checking for that is unnecessary.

    non-standard effort.

    Added field checking on stopID
    
    Moved around isValid checking: Now just create an arrival around a stopid,
    and use the arrival's isValid instead of LaMetroUtil. LaMetroUtil isValid
    now only checks raw strings, as passed from the arrivals.
    
    This change results in the isValid() check in TripPopulator now correctly
    ignoring input. The previous crashes were actually in LaMetroUtil.
    
    This has solved StopID-related input crashing.
